External Organizations
========================

Australia (Stuart/Dima)
-------------------------
* Eventual alignment happening to FAPI. Big 4 and Two recipients seem to be aligned to FAPI 1.0 and not CDR. 
* Round table today with Ping Identity Banking API Lead. He indicated his vision to push towards FAPI 2.0 (or all the specs that form FAPI 2.0) during the 12-month extension. 
* It has been good progress. Mark Verstege API Lead @ Data 61 leading towards convergence. 
* In UK, Fintechs never used Sandbox but only live accounts of friends and family to test. So, it took about a year before it starts picking up. 
* Ping announced sandbox: 
* Ping is serving two of four banks. 


UK (Chris)
------------------
* On track for ver. 3.1. Only small change for account switching from one bank to another. CASS (Current Account Switch Service).
