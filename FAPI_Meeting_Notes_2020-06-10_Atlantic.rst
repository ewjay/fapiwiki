Australia (Stuart/Dima)
-------------------------
* Eventual alignment happening to FAPI 1.0. On some issues, Big 4 and Two recipients seem to be aligned to normative standards like FAPI 1.0 and not CDR.
* Open Banking Round table today where Data61 Banking API Lead Mark Verstege indicated his vision to push towards FAPI 2.0 (or all the specs that form FAPI 2.0).
* In UK, Fintechs never used Sandbox but only live accounts of friends and family to test. So, it took about a year before Open Banking adoption started picking up.
* Ping has just announced CDR sandbox availability https://www.pingidentity.com/en/company/press-releases-folder/2020/consumer-data-right-sandbox-open-banking-australia.html
