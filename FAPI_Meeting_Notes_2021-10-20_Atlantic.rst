Issues (Dave/Nat)
=====================
#456 - Refresh Token Rotation 
-------------------------------------
Since FAPI 2 is fully sender constrained, Refresh Token Rotation is probably not needed. 

AU experience shows that it is a bad idea to rotate refresh tokens. 

Agreed to put some text about recommending not to rotate refresh tokens. 

Stuart was assigned the issue.
