Adoption of Agenda (Dave)
===========================

External Organizations
=====================
Workshop & US FDX (Don)
------------------------
A workshop in conjunction with FDX is in planning. 
What is being asked to the WG is much the same as the one with UK OB last week. 

It is at least three weeks away. 

UK (Chris)
-------------
Roadmap taking the crisis period is being published eminently. 

Pushing CMA-9 for certification. Better visibility through shared ticketing system etc. is desirable. It is to be considered offline. 

Australia (Stuart)
-------------------
Stuart and Dima are working on the draft response [1] to the Farrel enquiry.

Issues
=============

#255 certification clarification request: location of discovery document
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whether to allow multiple issuers or only single issuer per authorization endpoint. 
For a mobile app to use authorization endpoint as the claimed uri, having multiple issuers 
associated with it is problematic. 

Also, the integrity of the discovery document is tied to the base of the Issuer URI.
