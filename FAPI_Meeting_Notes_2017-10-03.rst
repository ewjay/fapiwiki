Verification: non-compliant JWT audience (Pam)
------------------------------------------------
A Lively discussion on this topic. 
One clear consensus item was that it is a bad idea to have the software ignore `aud` value. 
Options are: 

1. Omit `aud`
1. Use logical `aud` (of Open Banking)
1. Use logical `aud` and the `client_id`
