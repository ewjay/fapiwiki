Adoption of Agenda (Dave)
===========================

External Organizations
=====================
Workshop & US FDX (Don)
------------------------
A workshop in conjunction with FDX is in planning. 
What is being asked to the WG is much the same as the one with UK OB last week. 

It is at least three weeks away. 

UK (Chris)
-------------
Roadmap taking the crisis period is being published eminently. 

Pushing CMA-9 for certification. Better visibility through shared ticketing system etc. is desirable. It is to be considered offline. 

Australia (Stuart)
-------------------
Stuart and Dima are working on the draft response [1] to the Farrel enquiry.
