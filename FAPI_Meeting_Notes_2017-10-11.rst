External Orgs
================
Berling Group Consultation (Nat)
----------------------------------
Berlin group consultation is out. There are some concerning wrting around OAuth and we may want to respond as OIDF-FAPI WG. The conslutations are found at the following links. 

1. https://www.berlin-group.org/market-consultations

Pam showed the section 4.3 and explained that while it does have code grant, it is markedly silent on the specifics. It also allows 'user password grant', which is concerning. Some comments were made that perhaps the existing APIs actually embed username and password in the request as some of the legacy APIs do. (Note: All the German banks have been mandated to have APIs for a long time.) 

Open Banking (Dave, Pam)
-------------------------
* request from OB to have more examples. 


Draft status and plans 
===========================

Streamlining the OBUK Implementer's Draft (Pam)
----------------------------------------------------

Verification: non-compliant JWT audience (Pam)
------------------------------------------------
Pam is going to create an issue on the OB side. 


Events
================
Open Banking F2F (Nat)
--------------------------
* Nat relayed the info from the last week's Atlantic call that one is planned on Oct. 17 in London. 

FAPI/Modrna joint F2F
-----------------------
* Date fixed on Nov. 7. Given Berling Group and API Days, Do we want it to be in Berlin instead? 
* That seems to be certainly possible but if it is going to be joint WG with Modrna, some logistical shuffling may be needed. 
* Carla will find out about the Microsoft event that is happening before the Berling group meeting. 

AOB
===========

Next Call (Atlantic)
-----------------------
* The meeting was adjourned at 23:52 UTC.
