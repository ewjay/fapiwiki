Most of the call was spent on this topic. 

After Dave has set the context around it by explaining the genesis of CIBA profile that FAPI WG has been working on and introduced the outcome of the Pacific call of the previous week where Sarah's proposal was taken up as a potential basis for a new work, Ralph was asked to provide the European context to it. 

Ralph explained that there is a requirement from PSD RTS that PSUs to surrender all their credentials to TPPs, based on the TPPs' use cases, despite the industry's effort to persuade that is a bad idea from the security point of view. Given the situation, we need to find a better way of doing it.
