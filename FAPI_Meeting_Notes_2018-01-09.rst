* What OBUK is working on is different and closer to the earlier version of OIDC registration. 
* It could, however, be reasonable for their use cases. 
* Need to be clear on the requirements, e.g., non-repudiation, etc. 
* We could bring some idea back to OIDC and OAuth. 
* Perhaps we can discuss more in details in the Atlantic call.
