FDX (Gail)
------------------
Had a follow up conversation with Don Cardinal and team before EIC.

Licensing questions regarding certification program. Three options

a) Don’t pursue licensing at this time due. Premature time. Continue as is.
b) Avoid forking of specifications and code. May entail auditing of certification program to maintain integrity, certified trust mark, etc...
c) Fully license..

Voice of the room was to avoid forking and have WG control of specifications to maintain interoperability. This only 
applies to security profile and not functional requirements.
