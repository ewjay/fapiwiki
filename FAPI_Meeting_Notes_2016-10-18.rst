Atlantic Call Report (Nat)
===============================
* Please refer to [[FAPI_Meeting_Notes_2016-10-12]]

=============================

UK Implementation Entity (Dave)
-------------------------------
There has been an update from the UK Implementation Entity:

Key points from a FAPI perspective:
 - The trustee has been appointed
 - Working groups and advisory boards are being convened
 - There is a push to ensure the API standards developed comply with PSD2 (and the RTS)

I hope to have more information before the call next week.
