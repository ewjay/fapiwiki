Working Draft 01
===================

* `WD1 Financial Services â€“ Financial API - Part 1: Read Only APIs <https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/src/ec8fde27efc98db7e9cd3e2a7c9d3afcd5aba01c/Financial_API_WD_001.md?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default>`_   

Restructuring (Nat)
----------------------
* 5 parts decomposition (Security Profile for Read Only, Security Profile for Read Write, 
  Open Data API, Read Only API, Read Write API.) 
* Nat also suggested that we may want to separate out the Data APIs into e.g., industries. 
* Anoop pointed out that such decomposition might not be easy since a bank may have to return 
  all the account types and transactions anyways. There are two options: 
  1. Get the list of accounts and then do another call to get the transactions; 
  2. Get the list of accounts with transactions, where a flag is set in the accounts list. 
* Anoop will send the details by creating a new ticket.

  ATM from the banking app.
