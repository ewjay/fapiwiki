 Agenda/notes:

* Reviewed Atlantic notes 
*  Update from Australia 
* * Election in May. From Operation perspective - Care taking mode. BAU mode. Security research will continue with Australian research group working with Stuttgart group. 
* Issue #469. Version profile. In Atlandtic call this has been discussed there is a different point of view. If there is different POV then we should update the issue.
* * How is transition between supporting FAPI profiles? Mark to review and provide input.
* * https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues/469/add-protocol-version-and-variant
* Change name of FAPI Issue #479. - There is push back on nameing . The concern/sentiment was - it already provides a level of financial grade even a finanacial entity can implement. They did not want yet another name change. More constructive was explaination of financial grade level. Fortified means something but not concrete as Financial Grade - which explain as fianancial grade level.
* FAPI1Adv - Issue # 494
* * It may cause interoperability issue, Not prohibited in spec to return only the subset it could expand the scope at its indescretion. 
* * Expected : The spec should generate an error when subset is returned. Not to return scope that has not been asked.
* Issue # 493 - Certification query. For FAPI2, support of DPop, RFC 8705 but we expand to DPoP it creates a complexity. 
* FAPI2 test suite is available now and few issues needs clarification & is in worked on. 
* Issue 492 (PR #327) - Security hole in Java for ECDSA and it is pretty serious. You can bypass security signature. Java version after 15 and oralce release hot fix (It coule be releated). 
* Liasions :
* * Lot of action in the Middle East. Starting require continuous testing/certification. 3rd patry certification. 
* * * Mark PoV - This should be norm and good to see some other jurisdiction are making it requiring it. The role different industry position that will support ongoing re-testing against FAPI. 
* * * Rotating key with every certification test and Log should reflect. Conitnuous certification is hard and should we Redact the logs. Certification team is looking into it.
 




* The meeting was adjourned at 01:48 UTC.
