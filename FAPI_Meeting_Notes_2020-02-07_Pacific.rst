Roll Call (Nat)
=====================

* Attending: Nat, Dima
* Guests: 
* Regrets: Anoop

Adoption of the Agenda:

Grant/Consent API 
======================
Dima asked Nat for a feedback on the Grant API that is being discussed in Atlantic call, especially on the PAR storage location. 
Nat expressed that what we should be defining is the external-facing API and not the server implementation. The location of the storage should be left for the implementation so that it can meet legal and business requirements. Then he explained that in OAuth JAR, he did not specify even the API location as there could be legal reasons to put it elsewhere than the AS. 

AOB
==============
Nat asked about the experience around Australian New Payment Platform (NPP). 
NPP seemed to have been created by SWIFT Co. so Nat may be able to ask about it in the forthcoming SWIFT meeting. 
In the meantime, Dima could ask some feedback from the FI PoV on the implementation experiences. 
 

* The meeting was adjourned at 01:16 UTC.
