1. Meeting notification and WG Page
---------------------------------------
Nat apologized that as he did not send the meeting 
invitation properly to the list, this meeting is 
informal. 

Edmund pointed out that the meeting URL is 
not properly put at the [WG page](https://openid.net/wg/fapi) that 
one has to dig into the meeting calendar to 
find the link. 

Nat updated the WG page on the fly and 
promised to send out the meeting invitation after the call. 

2. New & Open Issues
------------------------
In the call, participants discussed the following issues 
listed in the [issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues)

* #2: Accounts: Total Pages and Page does not make sense
* #4: Remove MessageFormat and references to it
* #7: Add "Open Data" data set
* #8: Should hard coded paths be avoided
* #10: Internationalization of strings
* #11: OAuth Profile should mandate RFC7636 (PKCE) for code flow
* #12: OAuth Profile should mandate per AS redirect URI for Clients with session comparison
* #13: TLS 1.0 should be banned
* #14: Allowed Redirection Client URI is not a defined term
* #15: Client Authentication, not Client Authorization
* #16: Client Authentication -- Do we need TLS mutual authentication?
* #17: Incomplete sentence "In line with FFIEC (Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council) guidance on Authentication to mitigate security risks."
* #18: "Authorization token" is not a defined term in RFC6749
* #19: Remove or Improve OAuth Interactions Diagram
* #20: Meaning of the Surrogate Identifier Clause not clear
* #21: Residual Data clause should be generalized and moved to privacy considerations
* #22: Undefined OAuth response parameter "user_id" appears in the text
* #23: How do I find AccountID to use in transfer?

The discussion results are recorded in each issue tickets. 
As far as the terminology is concerned, it was prevailant among the callers 
that OAuth term should be used instead of creating something else. 

Some of the issue was related to the ambiguity etc. of 
the DDA spec that we are basing on. These (#17, #20, #22) was 
assgined to Anoop.
