Issues
==========================

#216: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA cipher suites
------------------------------------
* https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues/216/tls_ecdhe_ecdsa-cipher-suites

Need to dig in why BCP195 is recommending only these four cipher suites. 

#215: Financial_API_Lodging_Intent should be an informational document
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* #215
* Torsten seems to be wanting it to be a standard. Since we are lacking both Torsten and Dave from this call, the discussion was postponed to the next call. 

#214: restricting 'aud' in request object to a single value (Joseph)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* #214
* This has come up when writing a test suit. 
* Although Joseph argues that there is no case where multiple `aud` is justifiably useful, there may actually be in the Open Banking so we need to at least check the current configuration and assess the impact of the change.
