Memo
-----
There are two main use cases for this standard: 

A Financial Institution or Service Provider uses the standard for it’s own applications and services. 
A Financial Institution or Service Provider uses the standard to expose an API for third party applications and services to use. 
The second use case will allow the market to transition from the current practice of “screen scraping”, which is brittle and insecure, to a robust API with structured data and a strong security model.
