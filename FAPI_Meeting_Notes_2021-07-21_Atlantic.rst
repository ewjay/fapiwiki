Brazil Phase 2 deadline has been extended to August 13, 2021. We still have 16 certifications to process as part of Phase 2 and expect those no later than Friday, August 6, 2021. 

The phase 3 deadline has been confirmed for August 31, 2021. Phase 3 banks are required to have certification requests to the Foundation no later than Monday, August 16, 2021. We are starting to receive inquiries from Phase 3 banks. We are in the process of confirming the banks and number of certifications with the Mirow team for Phase 3. 

The central bank and the Security Working Group as still considering requiring RP certifications in BR. There is strong support thus far. These certifications would not be required until later this year. 
CIBA is going to be required but not until Q4 2021. The exact milestones are being confirmed

* Phase two is delayed until 13th August.
