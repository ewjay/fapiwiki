* Regrets: 

Adoption of the Agenda (Nat)
==================================
* Adopted as is. 

External Orgs
================

Open Banking (Dave)
-----------------------

Berlin Group (Torsten)
------------------------


Draft status and plans 
===========================

Streamlining the OBUK Implementer's Draft (Pam)
----------------------------------------------------
* Pam is working diligently on the refactoring of OBUK profile. Please track the repo for changes and issues. 

Issues
-----------------
* There are a bunch of issues for OBUK subgroup. Bjorn asked whether it is appropriate to discuss it in the FAPI list and the call and Nat responded that it is a sub-group so it is appropriate to do it within FAPI. 
* For X-FAPI-* header, it seems the WG is precipitating to dropping "X-" portion. Nat will check back with Open Banking. 

Events
================
IIW
-----
Tony is not going to be there. 
Nat might not be also as he may get a speaking opportunity at Automotive Linux Summit. 
Never-the-less, we should give a talk at IIW. Bjorn and John will be there so perhaps they should host a session. 
Modrna WG will be talking about CIBA. 

FAPI/Modrna joint F2F
-----------------------
Candidate dates are now: 

# Nov. 7

Nat will finalize the date this week after talking to the Open Banking. 

Berlin Group
-------------------
Berling Group will be hosting a workshop in the last week of October. 
Torsten suggested that some of us attend it. 

APIDays Berlin
-------------------
If the dates for the joint FAPI/Modrna meeting will be in November 7, 
then someone else than Nat needs to be assigned. 

AOB
===========
Testing
--------------
* Progress at the OB seems to be slow. We need to keep our eyes on it. 

Next Call (Atlantic)
-----------------------
* The meeting was adjourned at 14:__ UTC.
