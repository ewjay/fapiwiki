Draft Statuses
==================
Lodging Intent Patterns & Pushed Request Object(Torsten)
------------------------------------------------------------
* https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/src/master/Financial_API_Lodging_Intent.md
* https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/src/master/Financial_API_Pushed_Request_Object.md

Torsten suggested to take the Pushed Request Object draft to IETF as there seems to be a momentum supporting it there. 

Nat asked Torsten to send the email about the intent to the list so that he can second it. 

Implementation Practice (Joseph)
---------------------------------------
* Joseph reported that it is ready to be merged. 

Cross-Browser Payment Initiation Attack (Torsten)
-------------------------------------------------------
* Current status suffices. No further action needed.
