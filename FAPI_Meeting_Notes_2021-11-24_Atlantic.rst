PayByLink http://lists.openid.net/pipermail/openid-specs-fapi/2021-November/002483.html

Request to pay. No interest in the market and has not taken off. 
Berlin group is also looking at something similar as a premium API. 

There is more interest in confirmation to pay but the current regulatory framework is lacking account linking to identity and causing a lot of fraud (same in PayByLink). Confirmation to Pay has made the situation worse.

GAIN (Gail)
---------------
Legal agreement is being developed. 
Target date likely shift to the beginning of January.
