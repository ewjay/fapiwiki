External Organizations (Nat)
================================
Australia (Dima/Joseph)
------------------------------------
Some meetings. 

Berlin Group (Francis)
----------------------------
OIDF response was favourably accepted and the response is being written. 
There seem to be many people who would like to join the effort. 

Brazil (Mike L)
---------------------
Ph.2 banks are going through certification. 10/15 went through. 
The deadline is tomorrow and needs to observe the effect. 

There are issues around Consent API that it has to bundle claims that true data collection minimization is not possible.

US/FDX (Mike L.)
------------------
Call with FDX. Reviewed original license agreement. 

Lukasz: what should be improved for fast adoption is, at formal level, open channel between FDX and FAPI. 

Open Banking in US looks like MiData. 

https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/ is the official note.

They describe it as "Encourages the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to issue rules allowing customers to download their banking data and take it with them."

The opportunity: A CFPB-issued open-banking regulation will make it easier for consumers to port their banking data and will simplify the bank-switching process. This could potentially help neobanks to pick off incumbentsâ€™ customers and persuade potential users to designate them as their primary banks. Neobanks would then profit from higher value per client and higher deposit totals. Convenient data movement would benefit challenger and incumbent banks alike by letting them share their data with fintechs. Banking players could then market seamless integration with fintechs as an enhancement to the customer experience to appeal to prospects and deepen existing customer relationships.
  * Will recommend but not require FAPI certification


MENA (Ali)
-----------------
* Had high-level workshop with Ali and Don. 
* Some opportunity with Abu Dhabi central bank as well. 

Grant Management (Dima)
==========================
Two scoping issues were discussed: Initially, for the WG and one for the FAPI 2.0 drafts.  

Most of the discussion was on FAPI 2.0 drafts on whether it should require the Grant Management draft now that it is getting queued for the public review. 

A question was asked if FAPI 2.0 ID2 can immediately follow ID1 and the answer from the chair was "yes". 

Some argued that it should to give more reasons for Banks to move from FAPI 1.0 to 2.0, as just simplicity does not give enough reasons for it. 

The discussion will be continued in the next session as well. 

AOB
