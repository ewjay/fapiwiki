PRs (Dave/Nat)
=====================


* issue #330 - potentially misleading language WRT JWT ATs - language is confusing

    - Suggested removing "opaque"
    - Intent is tat AT is not to be consumed by clients
    - remove "opaque" and reword note, make it similiar to RFC 6749 language that AT is usually opaque to clients
    - No PR yet



* issue #317 

    - Reassigned to Dave
