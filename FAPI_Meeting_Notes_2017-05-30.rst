* Assuming OB contributing their APIs, we can use them to create part 3 and 5. 
* For Part 4, we have to reconcile DDA and OB. 
* For stock trading use cases, NRI plans to submit API as well. 

AOB
===========
* Japanese Banking Act has been amended on May 26. Banks now have to spend reasonable effort to provide APIs.
