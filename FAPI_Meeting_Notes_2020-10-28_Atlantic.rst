PRs (Dave/Nat)
=====================

* pull request #199
    -  editorial / accepted 
* pull request #200 regarding returning PII in ID Token
    - Encryption is not encourages, claims can be returned in the back channel
    - Encryption is abd for third parties
    - Change to "should not return PII in ID Token, but if you do, then you should encrypt"
* pull request #198 - unclear TLS ciphersuites language
    - Joseph concerned about new text.
    - BCP195 had recommended and permitted ciphers 
    - Donâ€™t want to allow not permitted ciphers
    - Old text allows only BCP195 permitted ciphers whereas new text allows non-permitted ciphers.
    - Old disability/accessibility software may be using old ciphers which will limit their access.
    - To be continued...
* pull request #197 - added BCP195 reference links
    - Accepted
* issue #329 - Rename FAPI Titles
    - Most support for changing to Part 1: Baseline and Part 2: Advanced
    - Keeping "Part 1" and "Part 2" since they will be submitted to ISO which will require putting these in the titles
    - Daniel concerned that Part 1 Advanced is closer to FAPI 2.0 Baseline
* pull request #163 - mix-up mitigation
    - Not sure whether to go with isser parameter or new mechanism
    - OAuth WG proposing mix-up mitigation proposal draft
    - Can either standardize at OAuth or FAPI WGs
* issue #330 - potentially misleading language WRT JWT ATs - language is confusing
    - Suggested removing "opaque"
    - Intent is tat AT is not to be consumed by clients
    - remove "opaque" and reword note, make it similiar to RFC 6749 language that AT is usually opaque to clients
