Especially https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/pull-requests/53/master/diff

Tom pointed out that it would be a good idea to put this ticket on hold and examine what could be done with web authentication. 

Issues
===========
* https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues?status=new&status=open

* #139 - treatment of returned scopes divergent from RFC 6749

Skipped as there are no Open Banking folks for this call. 

AOB
===========
Call time change?
--------------------
* Participants were ok to change the call time so that it will be 22:00 UTC to be a little easier for UK folks to call in. Nat will consult with the UK side to decide what to do. 

Name change?
-----------------
* Name change proposed at the last board meeting. Members are reminded of their task of coming up with a name. 
  Nat suggested a retrofit acronym: ** Full Assurance Protection Interoperable ** 
* Participants agreed that ** Full Assurance Protection Interoperable ** is actually pretty good and represent what we do on the security side: protect the API. 


Next Call
-----------------------
The next call is scheduled to be in the Atlantic time zone. 

* The meeting was adjourned at 23:55 UTC.
