Adoption of the Agenda (Dave)
==================================


External Organizations
=======================

Australia (Dima/Stuart)
-------------------------

call being arranged with Rob Hanson
Australia have decided to use Dynamic Registration - they have published a spec which is similar to UK OpenBanking.
Next interesting topic is consent - lack of consent API

PSD2
-----
Berlin Group embedded mode is mainly adopted in Germany, not because of PSD2 but because of a competition-based lawsuit. 

Outside of Germany, many banks are implementing OAuth based APIs. E.g. Romania, etc.

Berlin Group editors will allow an explicit confirmation of payment - so payments aren’t made during the authorisation. 

Need to make sure that Security BCP / FAPI  alignment - and that landing page is good resource

There was a discussion about tweaking the name - R/RW -> basic / advanced
Dave to email list, possibly there to be discussion at IIW
