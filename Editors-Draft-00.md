Financial API consists of the following parts, under the general title Financial Services — Financial API:

* Part 1: Read Only APIs
* Part 2: Read and write APIs

This part is intended to be used with [RFC6749], [RFC6750], [RFC6736], and [OIDC]. 

##Introduction

In many cases, Fintech services such as aggregation services uses screen scraping and stores user passwords. This model is both brittle and insecure. To cope with the brittleness, it should utilize an API model with structured data and to cope with insecurity, it should utilize a token model such as OAuth [RFC6749, RFC6750].

This working group aims to rectify the situation by developing a REST/JSON model protected by OAuth. Specifically, the FAPI WG aims to provide JSON data schemas, security and privacy recommendations and protocols to:

* enable applications to utilize the data stored in the financial account,
* enable applications to interact with the financial account, and
* enable users to control the security and privacy settings.

Both commercial and investment banking account as well as insurance, and credit card accounts are to be considered.

## 5. Getting Tokens

### 5.1 Introduction

The OIDF Financial API (FAPI) is a REST API that provides JSON data representing accounts and transactions related data. These APIs are protected by the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework that consists of [RFC6749], [RFC6750], [RFC7636], and other specifications.

These API accesses have several levels of risks associated to it. Read only access is generally speaking associated with lower financial risk than the write access. As such, the characteristics required to the tokens are also different.

In the following subclauses, the method to obtain tokens are explained separately.


### 5.2 Read Only Access Provisions

Read Only Access typically is the lower risk scenario compared to the Write access, so the protection level can also be lower. However, since the FAPI would provide potentially sensitive information, it requires more protection level than a basic [RFC6749] requires. 

To request the authorization to acess the protected resource in question, the client uses the OAuth scope values defined in table 1. 

| Resource       | Allowed Actions                                              | Scope value          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Account        | Read only Access to summary account information              | FinancialInformation |
| Customer       | Read only Access to customer information, including PII      | FinancialInformation |
| Image          | Read only Access to transaction images (checks and receipts) | FinancialInformation |
| Statement      | Read only Access to statement image                          | FinancialInformation |
| Transaction    | Read only Access to transaction information                  | FinancialInformation |

Table 1 - Financial API Scopes

As a profile of The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework, this specification mandates the following to the Read Only API of the FAPI.

#### 5.2.1 Authorization Server 

The Authorization Server

* shall support both public and confidential clients; 
* shall provide client secret longer than 12 characters; 
* shall support [RFC7636] with `S265` as the code challenge method;
* shall require Redirect URIs to be pre-registered; 
* shall required `redirect_uri` parameter in the authorization request; 
* shall require the value of `redirect_uri` to exactly match one of the pre-registered Redirect URI;  
* shall require user authentication at LoA 2 as defined in [X.1254] or more; 
* shall require explicit consent by the user to authorized the requested scope if it has not been previously authorized;  
* shall verify that the Authorization Code has not been previously used if possible; 
* shall return the token response as defined in 4.1.4 of [RFC6749]; and 
* shall return the list of allowed scopes with the issued access token.  

    **NOTE**: The Financial API server may limit the scopes for the purpose of not implementing certain APIs.

    **NOTE**: Section 4.1.3 of [RFC6749] does not say anything about the `code` reuse, but this document is putting limitation on it as per Section 3.1.3.2 of [OIDC]. 

    **NOTE**: If replay identification of the authorization code is not possible, it is desirable to make the validity period of the authorization code very short. 

Further, if it wishes to provide the authenticated user's identifier to the client in the token response, the authorization server 

* shall support the authentication request as in Section 3.1.2.1 of [OIDC]; 
* shall perform the authentication request verification as in Section 3.1.2.2 of [OIDC]; 
* shall authenticate the user as in Section 3.1.2.2 and 3.1.2.3 of [OIDC]; 
* shall provide the authentication response as in Section 3.1.2.4 and 3.1.2.5 of [OIDC] depending on the outcome of the authentication; 
* shall perform the token request verification as in Section 3.1.3.2 of [OIDC]; and 
* shall issue an ID Token in the token response when `openid` was included in the requested `scope` 
  as in Section 3.1.3.3 of [OIDC] with its `sub` value equal to the value of the `CustomerId` 
  of the `Customer` object corresponding to the authenticated user
  and optional `acr` value in ID Token. 

    NOTE: [DDA] returns a parameter called `user_id` in the token response. 
    The value of `user_id` is identical to the value of `CustomerId` member of the `Customer` object. 

    Editor's Note: Requiring similar mechanism to PKCE to the Refresh and Access Token a good idea?

    Editor's Note 2: If `user_id` is indeed required in the token response of DDA, then, we should require OIDC. 


#### 5.2.2 Public Client

A Public Client

* shall support [RFC7636];
* shall use the [RFC7636] with `S256` as the code challenge method;
* shall use separate and distinct Redirect URI for each Authorization Server that it talks to;
* shall store the Redirect URI value in the User-Agent session and compare it with the Redirect URI that the Authorization Response was received at, where, if the URIs do not match, the Client shall terminate the process with error;
* shall adhere to the best practice stated by [BCP NAPPS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-native-apps-03); and 
* shall implement an effective CSRF protection. 

Further, if it wishes to obtain a persistent identifier of the authenticated user, it 

* shall include `openid` in the `scope` value; and 
* shall include `nonce` parameter defined in Section 3.1.2.1 of [OIDC] in the authentication request.  

    NOTE: Adherence to [RFC7636] means that the token request includes `code_verifier` parameter in the request.


#### 5.2.3 Confidential Client

In addition to the provision to the Public Client, the Confidential Client 

* shall authenticate the client with client secret to access the Token Endpoint as in Section 4.1.3 of [RFC6749]; 


## 6. Accessing Protected Resources (Using tokens)

### 6.1 Introduction

The FAPI endpoints are OAuth 2.0 protected resource endpoints that return various financial information for the resource owner assoicated with the submitted Acccess Token. 

### 6.2 Read only access provisions 

#### 6.2.1 Protected resources provisions

The protected resources supporting this document 

* shall mandate TLS 1.2 as defined in [RFC5246] or later with the usage following the best practice in [RFC7525]; 
* shall support the use of the HTTP GET and HTTP POST methods defined in [RFC2616]; 
* shall accept access tokens in the HTTP header as in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750];  
* shall verify that the access token is not expired nor revoked; 
* shall verify that the scope associated with the access token authorizes the reading of the resource it is representing; 
* shall identify the associated user to the access token;  
* shall only return the resource identified by the combination of the user implicit in the access and the granted scope and otherwise return errors as in section 3.1 of [RFC6750]; 
* shall encode the response in UTF-8; // DDA allows client to ask for charset but restricting may be better for interoperability
* shall send the `Content-type` HTTP header `Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8`;  
* shall send the server date in HTTP date header as in section 14.18 of [RFC2616];  
* shall send the `DDA-InteractionId` with the value set to the one received from the client in the `DDA-InteractionId` request header or a unique value created by the server if there was no corresponding request header to track the interaction, e.g., `DDA-InteractionId: c770aef3-6784-41f7-8e0e-ff5f97bddb3a`; and 
* shall log the value of `DDA-InteractionId` in the log entry. 


    NOTE: While this document does not specify the exact method to find out the user associated with the 
    access token and the granted scope, the protected resource can use OAuth Token Introspection [RFC7662]. 

Further, it 
 
* should support the use of Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) [CORS] and or other methods as appropriate to enable Java Script Clients to access the endpoint; 

### 6.2.2 Client provisions

The client supporting this document 

* shall use TLS 1.2 as defined in [RFC5246] or later with the usage following the best practice in [RFC7525]; 
* shall send access tokens in the HTTP header as in Section 2.1 of OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750];   
* shall send `User-Agent` header that identifies the client, e.g., `User-Agent: Intuit/1.2.3 Mint/4.3.1`; and 
* shall send `DDA-FinancialId` whose value is the unique identifier of the desired financial institution to interact assigned by the service beureau where the API is provided by a service bureau which uses the same end point for multiple institutions. 

    **NOTE**: Conceptually, the value of the DDA-FinancialID corresponds to `iss` in the ID Token 
    but is not required to be an https URI. It often is the routing number of the FI. 

Further, the client 

* can optionally supply the `sub` value associated with the customer with the `DDA-CustomerId` request header, e.g., `DDA-CustomerId: a237cb74-61c9-4319-9fc5-ff5812778d6b`; 
* can optionally supply the last time the customer logged into the client in the `DDA-CustomerLastLoggedTime` header where the value is supllied as ** w3c date **, e.g., `DDA-CustomerLastLoggedTime: Tue, 11 Sep 2012 19:43:31 UTC`; and 
* can supply the customer’s IP address if this data is available or applicable in the `DDA-CustomerIPAdress` header, e.g., `DDA-CustomerIPAdress: 198.51.100.119`; and 
* may send the `DDA-InteractionId` request header to the server to help correlate log entries between client
and server, e.g., `DDA-InteractionId: c770aef3-6784-41f7-8e0e-ff5f97bddb3a`. 


### 6.2.3 Open access resource provisions



## 7. Resource APIs

### 7.1 Introduction

This document specifies resources in two categories: 

* open access resources;
* protected resources; 

Open access resources does not require authorization to read them out. 
This document defines the following open access resources:

* Branch location
* ATM location
* Offered products list
* Offered product
* API service availability
* API service capability
* etc. 

Protected resources require the access token as defined above to read them out. 
This document defines the following protected resources: 

* customer; 
* account; 
* transaction; 
* transfer;
* transfer status;
* statement; 
* etc. 

### 7.2 Endpoint Discovery

    Editor's Note: In the following, we are currently citing OpenID Connect Discovery but
    once OAuth Server Metadata is done, it should be changed to it. 

This document defines a mechanism for discovering the various resources endpoints for requesting the user's financial data. It defines two ways of doing it i.e., 

* server metadata document; 
* Enhanced HAL; 

Server metadata document builds upon the discovery mechanism described in OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0. This document defines the parameters defined in Table 2 to the OpenID Discovery response.

In case of using HAL, JSON describing the link is returned as a part of the resource being returned. 

| Parameter         | Type  | Description                                                                                |

#### 7.3.5 Capability

**Capability** represents the capabilities and supported features of the API service.

Following is a non-normative example of capability request.

```
GET /capability HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json
```

Following is a non-normative example of the capability response.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
  "_links": {
       "self": { "href": "/capability" }
  },
  "Capability": {
    "allowedConnections": 10,
    "supportsCustomer": true,
    "supportsAccounts": true,
    "supportsTransactions": true,
    "supportsImage": true,
  }
}
```

### 7.4 Protected resources 

#### 7.4.1 Customer  

A **customer** is an OAuth protected resource that represents the customer referred to by the access token presented.
It is represented as a URI from which the client can GET the JSON representation. 
The client is only allowed to obtain the data within the granted scope. 

    Editor's Note: The DDA seems to be quite particular not to use customerId 
    but the "surrogate identity (identifier)", which is the access token. 
    However, the token endpoint returns cusotmer_id and this is represented in 
    the HTTP header all the time. Need to find out what it is trying to achieve. 

The detail of this object is defined in Appendix A as a swagger.  

Following is a non-normative example of the resource request. 

```
GET /customer HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer w0mcJylzCn-AfvuGdqkty2-KP48=
User-Agent: Intuit/1.2.3 Mint/4.3.1
Accept-Charset: UTF-8
```

Following is a non-normative example of the resource response. 

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
  "_links": {
       "self": { "href": "/customer" }
  },
  "Customer": {
    "name": {
      "first": "Michael",
      "middle": "J",
      "last": "Smith",
      "company": "Acme"
    },
    "taxId": "144-27-7471",
    "CusotmerID": a237cb74-61c9-4319-9fc5-ff5812778d6b
  }
}
```

  **NOTE**: It is similar to the UserInfo endpoint of [OIDC]. 

#### 7.4.2. Account Descriptor List 

An account descriptor list is an OAuth protected resource that represents the list of account descriptors, the metadata about the account, associated with the provided access token, which is related to the customer in question.

The detail of this object is defined in Appendix A as a swagger. 

Following is a non-normative example of the resource request. 

```
GET /accountDescriptorList HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer w0mcJylzCn-AfvuGdqkty2-KP48=
```

Following is a non-normative example of the resource response. 

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
  "_links": {
       "self": { "href": "/accountDescriptorList" },
       "fapi.account": {
          "href": "/accounts{?accountId}",
          "Authorize":"Bearer {access_token}",
          "Method":"POST", 
          "templated":true}
  }, 
  "AccountDescriptorList" : [
    {
      "AccountId" : "1357902468",
      "AccountType" : "SAVINGS",
      "DisplayName" : "Savings Account",
      "Status" : "OPEN",
      "Description" : "Savings Account",
    },
    {
      "AccountId" : "3216540987",
      "AccountType" : "CHECKING",
      "DisplayName" : "Checking Account",
      "Status" : "OPEN",
      "Description" : "Checking Account",
    }
  ]
}
```

     Editor's Note:  /me/accountDescriptorList might look more REST like. 

#### 7.4.3 Account 

An **account** is an OAuth protected resource that represents the account of the customer in question.
It is represented as a URI from which the client can obtain the JSON representation. 
It may be HAL+ enhanced. 
The client is only allowed to obtain the data within the granted scope. 
It has an identifier unique to the issuing organization called `accountId`.

Since the access token only identifies the customer and the customer might have multiple accounts, account identifier, `accountId`, which is provided in the account descriptor needs to be provided. 

The detail of this object is defined in Appendix A as a swagger.  

Following is a non-normative example of the resource request. 

```
POST /account HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer w0mcJylzCn-AfvuGdqkty2-KP48=
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

accountId=1357902468
```

Following is a non-normative example of the resource request. 

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
  "_links": {
       "self": { "href": "/accounts/?accountId=1357902468" },
       "fapi.statements": {
          "href": "/statements{?accountId,startTime,endTime}",
          "Authorize":"Bearer {access_token}",
          "Method":"POST", 
          "templated":true},
       "fapi.transactions": {
          "href": "/account/transactions"},
  }, 
  "DepositAccount" : {
    "AccountId" : "1357902468",
    "AccountType" : "SAVINGS",
    "DisplayName" : "Savings Account",
    "Status" : "OPEN",
    "Description" : "Savings Account",
    "ParentAccountId" : "2468135790",
    "Nickname" : "My Savings Account A",
    "AccountNumber" : "4561237890",
    "InterestRate" : 3.0,
    "InterestRateType" : "FIXED",
    "MicrNumber" : "9753108642",
    "BalanceAsOf" : "2015-01-01Z",
    "CurrentBalance" : 1000.00,
  }
}
```

While GET is more REST like, in the above example, POST is used   
so that the accountId is not exposed as a path / query, 
which may expose the accountId through referrer and history. 

#### 7.4.4 Statements 

Gets a list of statements for the given account.

```
POST /account/statements HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer w0mcJylzCn-AfvuGdqkty2-KP48=
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

accountId=1357902468&startTime=2015-01-01Z&endTime=2015-02-01Z&page=1
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
{
  "_links": {
       "self": { "href": "/accounts/statements?accountId=1357902468" },
       "fapi.statement": {
          "href": "/statement/{?accountId,statementId}",
          "Authorize":"Bearer {access_token}",
          "Method":"POST", 
          "templated":true}
  }, 
  "Statements" : {
    "Total" : "1",
    "TotalPages" : "1",
    "Page" : "1",
    "Statement" : [
      {
        "AccountId" : "1357902468",
        "StatementId" : "ST875376081768363584636",
        "StatementDate" : "2015-01-01Z",
        "Description" : "Statement for 2015-01-01",
      },
      {
        "AccountId" : "1357902468",
        "StatementId" : "ST962558772885635484949",
        "StatementDate" : "2015-02-01Z",
        "Description" : "Statement for 2015-02-01",
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

    Editor's Note: Is StatementId unique to the org or to the AccountId? 

#### 7.4.5 Statement 

A **statement** represents an image of an account statement. It can be one of the following formats:

* application/pdf
* image/gif
* image/jpeg
* image/png
* image/tiff

## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1 TLS Considerations
Since confidential information is being exchanged, all interactions shall be encrypted with TLS/SSL (HTTPS) in accordance with the recommendations in [RFC7525]. TLS version 1.2 or later shall be used for all communications.

### 8.2 Message source authentication fialure

Authorization request and response are not authenticated. 

### 8.3 Message interity protection fialure

Authorization request and response tamparing and parameter injection

### 8.4 Message containment failure

#### 8.4.1 Authorization request and response

#### 8.4.2 Token request and response

May leak from logs. 

#### 8.4.3 Resource request and response

May leak from referrer. 


## 9. Privacy Considerations

### 9.1 Privacy by design

* Privacy impact analysis (PIA) should be performed in the initial phase of the system planning. 
* For PIA, use of ISO/IEC 29134 Privacy impact analysis - Guidelines is recommended. 
* The provider should establish a management system to help respect privacy of the cusotmer. 

### 9.2 Adhering to privacy principles

Stakeholders should follow the privacy principles of ISO/IEC 29100. In particular: 

1. Consent and Choice
2. Purpose legitimacy and specification
3. Collection limitation
4. Data (access) limitation
5. Use, retention, and data disclosure limitation:
    1. Use limitation:   
    1. Retention limitation: Where the data is no longer being used, clients should delete such data from their system within 180 days except for the cases it needs to retain due to the legal restrictions; 
    1. Data disclosure limitation: 
6. Accuracy and quality
7. Openness, transparency and notice
8. Individual participation and access
9. Accountability
10. Information security
11. Privacy compliance
