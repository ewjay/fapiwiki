Michael Palage's proposal: Digital Identity. Despite the critical role that digital identity plays, it is a widely misunderstood concept. We propose to take a holistic approach toward the topic through the single unifying lens of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a) Definition. An alphabet soup of terms used in digital identity in different technical standards/protocols and governance frameworks. Based on the current best thinking there is a need to agree on a working definition of digital identity. b) Technical Implementation. We need to look number of specific digital identity technical implementations and the strengths and weaknesses of each, and on how closely it aligned to the relevant articles in the UDHR and the OHCHR. c) Emerging Trust Frameworks. We need to look at some of the emerging trust frameworks that have been proposed to implement digital identity and identify points of convergence and divergence. d) Business Models. We need look at the various business models for digital identity solutions (private/public/hybrid), and how cultural considerations may have acted as a barrier to implementation in some countries. As the EU moves forward with proposed revisions to eIDAS regulations, it is importance for both the public and private sector to have an open dialog about digital identity. If the EU is successful, the revised eIDAS regulations can become the gold stands in digital identity.

PRs (Dave/Nat)

#269 - Compilable http signing, a lot of rejigging to get references right

Joseph mentioned the glitch that may happen for the pipeline. 

#270 - Compilable deployment advice updates (Stuart)
-----------------------------------------------------

Issues (Dave/Nat)
=====================
#464 - Review casing of keywords (Travis)
---------------------------------------------
It will be reviewed. Assigned to Dima. 

#461 - FAPI2-Baseline - has the time come to recommend/require TLS 1.3? (Joseph)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The working group agreed to recommend to contain TLS 1.2 just like in FAPI 1.0. 

#460 - FAPI2-Baseline TLS restrictions are written as prose
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Editorial one suggesting the text to be converted to a bullet list so that they can be enumerated. 

To be addressed with #461. 

There is an argument that if we allow rotation of refresh tokens it should happen relatively regularly so it doesn't become a surprise to the clients down the road.

23:51Kosuke Koiwai to Everyone
My personal note regarding TLS1.3 discussion we had in Oct.30:

23:51Kosuke Koiwai to Everyone
216 - any chance to update BCP195? could be just 1 line doc saying use TLS1.3 
so if BCP195 wonâ€™t be updated how can we. Wait for TLS1.3 to widely available? 
already issue with UK OB. prefer adding those two but need expert advice. 
trying to email to relevant WG for input?
