Michael Palage's proposal: Digital Identity. Despite the critical role that digital identity plays, it is a widely misunderstood concept. We propose to take a holistic approach toward the topic through the single unifying lens of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: a) Definition. An alphabet soup of terms used in digital identity in different technical standards/protocols and governance frameworks. Based on the current best thinking there is a need to agree on a working definition of digital identity. b) Technical Implementation. We need to look number of specific digital identity technical implementations and the strengths and weaknesses of each, and on how closely it aligned to the relevant articles in the UDHR and the OHCHR. c) Emerging Trust Frameworks. We need to look at some of the emerging trust frameworks that have been proposed to implement digital identity and identify points of convergence and divergence. d) Business Models. We need look at the various business models for digital identity solutions (private/public/hybrid), and how cultural considerations may have acted as a barrier to implementation in some countries. As the EU moves forward with proposed revisions to eIDAS regulations, it is importance for both the public and private sector to have an open dialog about digital identity. If the EU is successful, the revised eIDAS regulations can become the gold stands in digital identity.
