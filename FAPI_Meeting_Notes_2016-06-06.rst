Nat explained the reason for having the IPR Agreement - to make sure that the end specification
is completely open and not encumbered by patent protected contributions.


ADOPTION OF THE CHARTER
=========================
* Charter link- openid.net/wg/fapi
* Nat reviewed the draft Charter.
* One thing is out of scope - web payment. Need to liaise with W3C Web Payment WG.
* Email is the primary vehicle for working group communication but
  there will still be regular monthly conference call for status checks.

The working group will schedule face-to-face meetings when convenient
adjacent to other industry events.

Nat opened the call to solicit any changes to the draft FAPI WG
Charter. There was none proposed. 

::

    Charter was adopted unanimously. 

SELECTION OF CHAIR
=====================
Nat Sakimura is the acting working group chair. 

Tony Nadalin from Microsoft and Anoop Saxena from Inuit have indicated
interest in being a co-chairs. 

The FAPI Working Group unanimously selected::

    Nat Sakimura (NRI), 
    Tony Nadalin (Microsoft), and 
    Anoop Saxena (Intuit) as co-chairs of the FAPI WG. 

MEETING SCHEDULE
=====================
Global participation creates meeting scheduling issues. 

Alternating working group call schedule was proposed: 

* (2) calls a month.
* (1) US/AsiaPac time and (1) US/EU time.

The FAPI Working Group meeting schedule to be posted to the working
group webpage. 

Action:: 
    Exact schedule is to be worked out in the mailing list. 

SPEC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY
==============================

Roadmap
------------

Nat proposed that the WG should consider the UK Open Banking Standard (OBS) schedule as it relates to the FAPI WG spec development. The release dates proposed by OBS are: 

* Release 1 - January 2017
* Release 2 - March 2017
* Release 3 - March 2018
* Release 4 - March 2019

Action:: 

    FAPI WG should beat the deadline enough to be adopted there.

Spec Format
-----------------
The Open Banking Standard suggests HAL, Swagger, and RAML.

Nat recommended HAL for defining the interaction between endpoints,
and Swagger for defining the interaction to an endpoint, for now. 

* Swagger: http://swagger.io 
* HAL: http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html

Spec Language
------------------
Nat suggested that as the FAPI WG may wish to submit the spec to ISO/TC 68 as: 

* ISO/TC68 is the maintainer of ISO 20022 Payment message catalogue.
 	* https://www.iso20022.org 

While historically we have been using IETF language, since we need
to consider this to be submit to ISO/TC68 at a later date, it would be
better to use ISO language described at http://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=4230456&objAction=browse&sort=subtype

WG unanimously agreed on it. 

Establishing a liaison relationship with the ISO/TC68 Financial Services
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a corollary, we probably want to establish a liaison with ISO/TC68. 

* To be discussed further at the OIDF board meeting on June 6, 2016.
* Mike Jones made the point that submission to ISO would be down the
  road once the specification has been developed.
* Tony Nadalin asked if the plan is to get the entire spec through ISO
  or just registering the spec with ISO? Nat suggested that would be
  determined later.

Recruitment of other members
-------------------------------
Nat pointed out the needs for reaching out. 
We need members from all the continents. 

* North America
* Latin America
* Europe
* Africa
* Asia


AOB
=====
Intuit is going to contribute Durable Data API (DDA) to the FAPI Working
Group. 

 * Currently being used by US financial institutions.
 * Nat reviewed the spec - very US-centric and needs to be
   internationalized but it is a good starting point otherwise.

Nat concluded the FAPI Working Group meeting at 9:50AM CST.
