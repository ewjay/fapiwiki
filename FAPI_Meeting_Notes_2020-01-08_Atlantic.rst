WG discussed the initial text created by Daniel. 

* https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues/163/more-description-of-the-security-model
* https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PtG4f-Svils7wHBa7cGaZubbh-6lGifce38c_oShSss/edit

They generally agreed that the attacker model is about right. 
Daniel also pointed out that there is one attack that we do not have a solution for. (PKCE chosen text attack.) 

WG members are invited to make comments on the document and the ticket. 
If it is a concrete change proposal to the document, it should go to the document itself. 
If it is a more general discussion, it should go to ticket #163.
