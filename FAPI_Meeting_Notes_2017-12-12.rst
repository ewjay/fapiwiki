Adoption of the Agenda (Nat)
==================================
* Adopted as is. 

FS-ISAC Response (Anoop)
=============================
Files: Privately shared. Please contact Anoop or Nat to get the document. 

* It is a long document. The first part is pretty high level and like a white paper. 
* Page 63 onwards talks more about the technical requirements. 
* The document is including FAPI. It probably is better to reference us instead as "updates" on our side can cause problems in updating theirs. 
* We should create written comments. Please add your comments to the shared Google doc. 

Dynamic Client Registration (Pam)
==================================
Files: https://bitbucket.org/openid/obuk/src/4630771db004da59992fb201641f5c4ff2c881f1/uk-openbanking-registration-profile.md?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default

* What OBUK is working on is different and closer to the earlier version of OIDC registration. 
* It could, however, be reasonable for their use cases. 
* Need to be clear on the requirements, e.g., non-repudiation, etc. 
* We could bring some idea back to OIDC and OAuth. 
* Perhaps we can discuss more in details in the Atlantic call.
