Issues 
========

#81: Identify user associated to the access token
----------------------------------------------------
Since Tom was not on the call last time, Nat asked Tom to explain his position. 
The point he made was that at least in the US, only a human being is allowed to authorize the transaction. 
Thus, the use of the term "user" instead of "entity" seemed more appropriate. 

Nat and John pointed out that it is true for the authorization step but 
this ticket is talking about the resource access step. 
In the resource access step, only the client and the resource is 
involved and it may well suffice to find out the account holder, 
which may well be a corporation and not human being, 
so expressing it as "user" would be confusing. 

Nat asked the group if they can come up with a better wording than "entity". 
Otherwise, the change from "user" to "entity" will be made in the next iteration.
