Adoption of the Agenda (Nat)
==================================



External Organizations
=======================

Australia (Nat/Dima/Stuart)
------------------------------
* Response letter was received on August 27 and forwarded to LC on Aug 28. 
* Some of their reading of security analysis seems to be misguided. 
* The letter also is almost exclusively talking about the security analysis and not about interoperability and the compatibility with existing infrastructure. 
* There was some concern expressed on the WTO Technical Barrier to Trade issues on creating and mandating a national standard that is incompatible with international standards. 
* Nat asked Don to involve certification team to do more in-depth analysis and drafting of the response. The certification team will have a call this Friday and Joseph will brief them of it. 
* The topic will be discussed again in the next Pacific call.
