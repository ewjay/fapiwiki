Agenda/notes:

* https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues/426/fapi-2-multiple-audience-values-in-client
* *  Dave will do a PR on this 
* https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues/282/fapi-20-x-fapi-headers
* *  x-fapi-interaction-id should not change in FAPI 2.0.
* other x-* can be reviewed. Auth time, IP address.
* Preferable standardize some of these via FAPI instead of each region coming up with custom header for same features.
* https://bitbucket.org/openid/fapi/issues/442/grant-vs-consent-confusion
* * This Might be difficult to align across regions. Good that this issue is created to clarify from FAPI perspective. Product/Tech approach (grant) vs legal (Consent).
* https://github.com/ConsumerDataStandardsAustralia/standards-maintenance/issues/397
* * request to add more ciphers. Follow up is to ask for the reasons/clarification why we needed it.
* Vote for grant management.
