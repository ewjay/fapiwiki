OIDF Workshop at Visa

The presentation deck has been published. Awaiting recording from Visa but will publish as soon as available.

Identiverse 2023

EIC 2023
-----------------------------

Mike will be developing a spreadsheet for Gail and Mike to track OIDF submissions for both conferences.
Mike will communicate the above to all WG co-chairs via email. 

Joseph noted that it seems the earlier you submit for EIC, the better your chances of getting submitted. 


External Orgs & Liaisons (Mike L./Chris)
============================================
SAMA
----------------
still awaiting their final KSA FAPI Profile specification and hope to receive the end of this week. This is impacting Joseph and the team developing the conformance test. We communicated to SAMA that it would likely be the end of December or early January before the production tests and certification is available.

Open Finance Brazil
---------------------------
continue to process a large volume of re-certification requests. We are also receiving quite a few new FAPI certification requests from Brazil as well.

OPIN
------ 
starting to see initial FAPI certification requests. OIDF and OPIN hosted a second FAPI outreach workshop recently for the OPIN ecosystem. Domingos Creado, with the certification team, delivered the workshop in Portuguese, which was very well received. I will be posting both OPIN workshop recordings to the OIDF website.

Open Banking Nigeria
----------------------------
The Central Bank of Nigeria has stalled on open banking since they released the draft guidance last May. It may be that their priorities have shifted from Open Banking to fighting inflation, releasing new currency designs, and pushing the e-Naira CBDC. Open Banking Nigeria have decided it wouldnâ€™t be easy to pull off auth and authorization over USSD with OAuth2 and FAPI at this time however, the team is still exploring some ideas to see how to make this work.

Website
------------
Joseph sent a request to update the FAPI name on the website and microsite. 

Mike responded that it doesn't make sense to update the microsite as that will be sunsetted by the end of the year. That's now been scheduled and will be offline by December 7th. We will have online access to the microsite once sunsetted, as we will repurpose most of the content within the new OIDF website.

Bruno with Design Factory just installed a tool this morning on the current OIDF website to make it most efficient to update the FAPI name and help ensure I don't miss any instances. I will try to get to this later today, but it may be early next week as I'm out of the office tomorrow through next Monday for the Thanksgiving holiday.
