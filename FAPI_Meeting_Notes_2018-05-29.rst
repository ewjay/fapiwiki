Adoption of the Agenda (Nat)
==================================
* As the draft agenda was not previously circulated, we bashed the agenda as follows on the fly. 

New Name for the WG (Nat)
===========================
* Financial-Grade API WG

Implementer's Draft (Nat)
==========================
* Part 1, 2: Wainting for the Review by Ralph, Joseph, and Brian to complete. 
* Non-redirect flow: e.g. CIBA Profile. 
* John to create a write up for the techniques that uses invisible iFrame this week so that we can compare the CIBA approach and this approach and decide on the direction. 

External Organizations
=========================

OpenBanking (Joseph)
----------------------
* Ralph is creating an updated delta set between FAPI and OB. 
   * Figuring out what Delta can be removed. 

ISO/TC68/SC 9 (Nat)
----------------------
* Released the first draft. Not much is changed. Part 1 and 2 are in there. 
* Since Part 1 and 2 are generic, it looks it is better to submit it as a PAS to SC 27 and TC 68 to reference it. 

Other EU SDOs (Nat)
------------------------
* STET and Berlin Group. STET has a problem with BG approach of allowing TPPs to obtain user's password as it is illegal in France. They are thinking of having per app password. 
* Joint Workshop towards the end of June.
