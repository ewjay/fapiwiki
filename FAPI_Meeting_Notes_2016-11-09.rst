External Org Relationships 
=============================
API Days (Nat)
-------------------
* http://www.apidays.io/
* There are two tracks that are of interest to us. 
    * The STATE OF API SECURITY : OAUTH, JSON WEB TOKENS, OPEN ID Connect, UMA; 
    * BANKING APIS and PSD2 (Payment Service Delivery)
* If we want to do both, we have to have two persons. 
    * We should find out who is going to be doing OAuth, JWT, OpenID Connect and UMA. 
    * Should contact Sascha to see if he knows the CA guy. 
* The organizers: Fabnoble and OAuth.io: We should try to access them in any case. 

Others
----------
We skipped the following as we had no updates. 

* Figo (Anton)
* OFX (Anoop)
* UK Implementation Entity (Dave)

Restructuring (Nat/Edmund)
----------------------------
* 

Issues 
=========================

#32: How to communicate back the partial errors to the client (Sascha/Edmund)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# issue #32
* Edmund reported that it could be done in Swagger as well using optional field etc. 
* Sascha still needs to close the ticket. 

#new: rename the HTTP header DDA-... To x-fapi- (Sascha)
-------------------------------------------------------------
* Still to be created. 

Events
=============

Pre-IETF (Nat/John)
--------------------
* John has made a room request. Waiting for the response. It is only two weeks away, so we probably will not have. 
* Nat has a conflict on Wednesday so he probably cannot attend OAuth WG meeting. 
* We have to see who is going to be there. 
    * John will be there Saturday to Saturday. 
    * William probably will not be there. etc. 

AOB
========

Next Call. Shift as DST ended? 
-------------------------------
* The default time is 2016-11-09 14:00 UTC (06:00 PT, 15:00 UK, 16:00 Denmark, 23:00 JST)
  as we are pegged to UTC, but all the callers were open for shifting it 1 hour later.
