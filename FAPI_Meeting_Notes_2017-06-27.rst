External Orgs
================

Berlin Group (Dave)
-------------------------------
* 


FS-ISAC (Anoop)
-------------------
*  

UK Open Banking (Dave)
---------------------------
* Detached signature on the resource response. 
* Status for OpenBanking Ltd. IPR contribution. Target time -- end of this month. 
* Registration and software statement: Central CA. etc. Is it something that we want to consider? 
  --> Worth having some recommendation but telling them how trust should work is hard. 
* Due to the regulatory requirements, a lot has to be done in the application layer. 

EBA Regulatory Technical Standards (Dave)
-------------------------------------------
* Fall back allowed if the API is not available for screen scraping. 
* Send the username and password over API ... 
* Fdata is writing a letter to drop this amendment. It does not make sense. 
* Very political. Some bank cannot produce the single view of the customer. 
  They can only provide API for the current account. 
  So, screen scraping is still needed. 
* Would there be a possibility of token based credential + screen scraping. (Aggregation code). 
* Brian to take a stab at a draft.
